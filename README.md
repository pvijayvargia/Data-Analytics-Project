# Exploring Wage Disparities Across Demographic Groups
using MySQL and Tableau

Hourly wage disparities across different demographic groups, including gender and race, have long been a subject of concern and interest. To gain deeper insights into these disparities and their underlying factors, this project aims to analyze a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing hourly wage data spanning from 1973 to 2022.

Key questions to be addressed include:

1. Identifying the years, categories, and education levels associated with the highest hourly wages for the overall population.<br>
2. Comparing average hourly wages between white men and black/Hispanic men with advanced degrees over time.<br>
3. Investigating whether there are years where hourly wages for men and women are equal and determining which gender category typically earns less.<br>
4. Analyzing the year with the largest difference in hourly wages between men and women across all education levels.<br>
5. Exploring trends in hourly wage disparities between white women and black/Hispanic women over the years.<br>
6. Assessing the impact of advanced degrees on hourly wages for black/Hispanic women compared to white women with bachelor's degrees.<br>
7. Identifying the education level that yields the maximum increase in hourly wages for the entire population.<br>
8. Examining variations in hourly wages across different education levels over time for black/Hispanic females.<br>
9. Determining whether there are years where black/Hispanic men with advanced degrees earn more than white men with advanced degrees.<br>
10. By addressing these questions, this project aims to contribute valuable insights into wage disparities and inform potential interventions or policy measures aimed at promoting equity in the labor market.<br>
